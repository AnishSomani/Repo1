		<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Generation of novel models of kidney defects using the. The zebrafish is a powerful genetic model of vertebrate development, including kidney organogenesis. Previous genetic screens isolated zebrafish kidney mutants in which nephrons-the functional units of the kidney-evince cyst formation. Work by many labs has revealed that cystic mutants harbor defects in ciliogenesis genes, and thus are relevant to study polycystic kidney disease. In recent years, it has become appreciated that zebrafish nephrons are segmented into functionally discrete domains of proximal and distal epithelial cells, similar to mammals, and that nephron progenitors express similar genes across these species. Many processes in the specification and differentiation of nephron cells from renal stem cells are difficult to study, and today remain poorly understood, due to the complex nature of mammalian kidney development. We hypothesize that the genetic pathways of nephrogenesis will be conserved between vertebrates. The features of the zebrafish embryo enable genetic screens of mutagenized genomes and interrogation of genetic pathways with small molecules, which we have used to begin delineating the genetic recipe of nephrogenesis. However, implementing a systematic genetic analysis of nephron cell type formation would proffer a wealth of meaningful new insights ultimately applicable to the prevention and treatment of congenital kidney defects. We propose to conduct a forward screen for heritable mutations that disrupt zebrafish nephron formation, and to use chemical libraries to identify small molecules that can modulate zebrafish renal progenitor patterning. In a pilot haploid screen with ENU-mutagenized zebrafish, we isolated a cohort of unique nephrogenesis mutants. These findings establish the precedence that our screen enterprise can successfully uncover novel mutations affecting nephron cell type formation. We will conduct a large-scale screen, then complementation and gene expression analyses to chronicle the kidney defects. In a parallel approach, we will employ chemical genetics to screen libraries of bioactive molecules with known targets and identify compounds that alter nephrogenesis. We will also determine the epistatic relationship between nephron genes and the known renal progenitor signals, retinoic acid and Notch. Finally, we will clone and further study a subset of the kidney mutations. The overall goal of this project is to establish a genetic toolkit that can facilitate and energize the burgeoning use of zebrafish in nephrology research. A fully annotated interface with mutant descriptions, images, and chemical phenotypes will be made freely available on the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), and kidney mutant distribution will be coordinated through the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC). These studies will produce a valuable commodity that will complement existing kidney research tools like the mammalian GUDMAP, and foster the use of zebrafish to formulate and test advanced hypotheses that can forge significant inroads into dissecting the genetic pathways of nephrogenesis.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

		<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[AbstractThe research community knows very little about how coming into compliance with specific safety standardscontributes to injury prevention. Only a few studies have addressed this issue even though a betterunderstanding would help OSHA target its inspections better among establishment; and it would help theinspector decide which violations to focus on once they arrived at a worksite. The research proposed here willsystematically examine the effects of compliance with particular standards by looking at changes in outcomesfollowing the abatement of violations of those standards. In addition to examining the change in the number ofinjuries, the study will also look at their severity by using workers' compensation data to measure the financiallosses that firms suffer as a result of the types of injuries that decline after specific standards are cited. Theeffectiveness of coming into compliance also depends upon its duration. We develop new methods to estimatethe average duration of compliance with different standards. To obtain our findings, we will use several differentdata sets. These include workers' compensation data from California and Pennsylvania as well as data from thenational Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>

		<ABSTRACT_TEXT><![CDATA[Alcohol dependence (AD) afflicts ~10% of the US population and causes serious morbidity andmortality. Ghrelin is a 28-aminoacid peptide that stimulates appetite and food intake. It is anendogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR1a). Preclinical studiessuggest that ghrelin also modulates alcohol reward processing. Central ghrelin administration tomice significantly increased alcohol intake, and this increase was even more robust when ghrelinwas administered bilaterally into specific brain reward nodes, e.g. the ventral tegmental area.Similarly, in alcoholic individuals, higher plasma ghrelin concentrations are associated with higheralcohol craving and consumption. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that manipulationsof the ghrelin system affect alcohol craving and consumption. Therefore, an orally bioavailable,ghrelin receptor antagonist, that can pass through the blood brain barrier holds particular promiseas an AD treatment. This proposal will allow us to generate preliminary evidence on the safetyand efficacy of such pharmacological agent via three projects, i.e.: (P1) a set of experimentstesting the effect of this drug in well-validated animal models of alcohol-seeking behavior; (P2) adrug/alcohol interaction study to establish safety in humans (Phase 1b); and (P3) a humanlaboratory study to assess the efficacy of this drug on alcohol-seeking behavior via a set of well-validated procedures (alcohol cue-reactivity, alcohol self-administration, intravenous alcoholprogressive ratio infusion) as well as characterization of the drug effect on reward processingneurocircuitry in the context of alcohol using fMRI (Phase 2a). These projects will be conducted inthe NIAAA Intramural Program (PI: Leggio). Furthermore, all three projects will includepharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) investigations conducted at University ofRhode Island (URI; PI: Akhlaghi). The PK/PD component will include (i) measuring total, unboundor tissue concentrations of the drug using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and evaluation of biomarkers of effect and (ii) estimation of PK and PD parameters inboth animal and human studies by the use of conventional and semimechanistic modelingapproaches to assist in identifying an optimal dosing regimen of the drug in AD. In summary, thisresearch will investigate the tolerability, efficacy and mechanism of this novel pharmacologicalapproach for AD thus leading to the potential identification of a new treatment for AD.]]></ABSTRACT_TEXT>
